[Scale Invariant Feature Transform(SIFT)](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lowe/papers/ijcv04.pdf) is an important technique to get important features from any image. The features are invariant to image scale, rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination. 


The SIFT feature detection are available in many advanced packages. But this project will implement only the First part of the Lowe's paper. This is useful if you want to implement SIFT from scratch and don't want to use the external libraries.


This project is the part of an assignment question in my university. The original paper is attached in the above hyperlink. For sake or readiblility the uploaded file is an jupyter notebook with all the intermidiate steps shown.
